               <p>This small tutorial is based on my past 16+ years of experience in software development industry. I have gone through different stages in my career starting from trainee software developer till senior management.

                I do not want to keep my learnings to myself, so I had written a small tutorial few years ago, and after getting lot of motivation from my dear readers, I thought of revising it and adding few more learnings which may benefit many other software engineers and developers working in this lovely industry.
